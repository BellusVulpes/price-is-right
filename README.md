# The Price is Right

## Instructions
In the initial commit to this project, you have been provided with files that contain a JavaScript module and some associated tests. Your task is to implement a `calculateTotal` function that will return a new list of items where each item has a new attribute called `total` with a value equal to the total price of that item. This exercise will be completed in class.
